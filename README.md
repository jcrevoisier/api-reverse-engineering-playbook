# API Reverse Engineering Playbook

This project demonstrates techniques for reverse-engineering hidden APIs from popular websites. By analyzing network traffic and understanding how web applications communicate with their backends, we can create clean, efficient scripts that interact directly with these APIs.

## What This Project Shows

- Using browser devtools and HAR files to discover hidden APIs
- Writing clean scripts to use APIs directly with Python's requests or httpx
- Properly handling headers, tokens, and pagination
- Documenting the reverse engineering process

## Examples Included

This repository includes examples from three popular websites:

1. **Twitter Search API**: Reverse engineering Twitter's search functionality
2. **Indeed Job Search API**: Accessing Indeed's job listings programmatically
3. **Yelp Business Search API**: Extracting business data from Yelp

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Chrome or Firefox browser with developer tools

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-reverse-engineering-playbook.git
cd api-reverse-engineering-playbook

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each API example can be run independently:

```bash
# Run the Twitter search example
python main.py twitter "python programming"

# Run the Indeed job search example
python main.py indeed "software engineer" "New York, NY"

# Run the Yelp business search example
python main.py yelp "coffee shops" "San Francisco, CA"
```

## Reverse Engineering Process

For each API, I've documented the reverse engineering process:

1. **Discovery**: Using browser devtools to identify API endpoints
2. **Analysis**: Understanding request/response patterns, headers, and authentication
3. **Implementation**: Creating a clean Python interface to the API
4. **Optimization**: Handling rate limits, pagination, and error cases

## Ethical Considerations

This project is for educational purposes only. When using these techniques:

- Respect robots.txt and terms of service
- Implement reasonable rate limiting
- Don't scrape personal information
- Use the official API when available
